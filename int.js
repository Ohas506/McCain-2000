McCain served his country more dutifly the most can claim, being taked a POW during the Vietnam war. His expierinces living through the tourture of his North Vietemise captiors only grew his love for America more. Returning to serve his home state of Arizona McCain has been noted as Mavrick, often not toeing the GOP line on most issues. As he runs  for president now he will have to face George W Bush, son of President HW Bush, and the presumptive favorite for the nomination. In light of this McCains campagin can be called many things, \"longshot\",\"foolish\", but to say its anything new for McCain, the life long \"dark horse\" could be farther from the truth.</div></div></div></div></div>","color_hex":"#ffd500","secondary_color_hex":null,"is_active":1,"image_url":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fa/McCain2_%281%29.jpg/180px-McCain2_%281%29.jpg","electoral_victory_message":"<h3>REAL PATRIOT DUMMY EXAMPLE SWEEPS</h3>","electoral_loss_message":"<h3>Fake News?</h3>","no_electoral_majority_message":"<h3>DUMMY EXAMPLE RETURNS TO HELL</h3>","description_as_running_mate":null,"candidate_score":1,"running_mate":false,"scrollable":true}},{"model":"campaign_trail.candidate","pk":77,"fields":{"first_name":"George.W","last_name":"Bush","election":9,"party":"Example Party","state":"Hell","priority":1,"description":"Dummy Example is a veteran from Hell.
